One day, on the border to the inner land inhabited by humans, one such being finds a girl on heaps of abandoned dead bodies. The girl says her name is Shiva and shows affection to the \"being\" who found her, calling him \"Teacher.\"  This is a story of two people—one human, one inhuman—who linger in the hazy twilight that separates night from day.",
